Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

------

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        vector<int>::iterator it;
        for(it = nums.begin(); it < nums.end(); it++) {
            if (*it==val) {
                nums.erase(it);
                it--;
            }
        }
        return nums.size();
    }
};
```
