# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Examples:**

Given `"abcabcbb"`, the answer is `"abc"`, which the length is 3.

Given `"bbbbb"`, the answer is `"b"`, with the length of 1.

Given `"pwwkew"`, the answer is `"wke"`, with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, `"pwke"` is a subsequence and not a substring.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        vector<int> m(256,-1);      //vector <int> M(a,b);//在M里装a个b
        int res = 0, left = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++)
        {
            left = max(left, m[s[i]]);
            m[s[i]]=i;
            res = max(res, i-left);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

用到了hash表，记录每个字母最后出现的位置。
